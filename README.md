hw 1 CIS 3500 landing page

This page is a landing page for my senior design project, which is a website to organize your research! It's built with Hugo and it uses github actions to auto-deploy when you push the branch. Feel free to check out a line by line explanation with a couple subroutines further explained by Claude AI in the explanation pdf. You can also see the code if you click into my .github/workflows folder
